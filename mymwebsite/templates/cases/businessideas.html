You can use our tool in two different fronts: the first one is internal, to follow up your subcontractors, track problems etc; the second one to show transparency to your client, by setting up, for instance, a Twitter account and automatically showing the progress online or sending automatic emails with photos showing ongoing jobs. By doing this you will better control your subcontractors and better inform your clients, all using the MyMensor Media Plan." %}</p>

Here you can see in the case for trade marketing exactly how MyMensor can help you run a small agency, with no big setups, no IT infrastructure, just using our service." %}</p>
